What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The Git concepts I struggled with most was merge conflicts. I did not fully understand how they occurred and I was unsure how to fix them when they did occur.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The concept of merge conflicts was definitely clarified through the example merge conflict we had to go through. Though it was a very minor conflict, it was really helpful to visualize what would happen when conflicts occurred. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked the guide several questions throughout the session. When creating the repository on github, I had several questions about the purpose of adding .gitignore, and the purpose of adding a license to the repository. Matthew was very helpful and gave informative examples as to why some repositories required .gitignore, and licensing. 

What still confuses you about Git?
I would like to say that nothing really confuses me about Git. A lot of my questions were answered during the session and I believe with simply more practice, I can master it.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Though I did not have a pair for this session, I really enjoyed working with my guide. He was very kind, patient, and helpful. It was reassuring working with someone who knew more than I did and I was glad that I could stop and ask questions whenever I was confused about certain concepts.
